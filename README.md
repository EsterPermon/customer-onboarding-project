# CustomerOnboardingProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

## Installing dependencies

Run `npm install` first to install all dependencies

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Considerations

It's important to keep in mind that this project's working time was only a few hours, so I had to compromise in order to deliver a working MVP. Here's a few features I would've implemented with more time:

- Reusable UI components
- Add tranlations with i18n
- Better error handling (showing error message specifically for each invalid field)
- Better mobile UI
- Unit tests for local storage logic & e2e tests with Cypress
